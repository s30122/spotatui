//! Local-file playback routing.
//!
//! This is the seam that keeps the Spotify [`Network`](crate::infra::network)
//! Spotify-only: [`route_local_event`] is called from the runtime IoEvent pump
//! *before* `handle_network_event`. When the event targets local files (a
//! `file://` playback URI, a transport control while a local file owns the
//! session, or a browse request) it is handled here and consumed; otherwise it
//! falls through to the normal Spotify dispatch.
//!
//! ## Decoupling
//!
//! Local playback owns a single piece of state, [`App::local_playback`]. This
//! module never writes Spotify/librespot fields (`native_track_info`,
//! `song_progress_ms`, `is_streaming_active`, …): the playbar reads progress and
//! pause state live from the player, so the two playback worlds cannot desync.
//!
//! ## Device ownership
//!
//! Only one backend holds the audio output device at a time (required on
//! exclusive-ALSA setups, harmless elsewhere). Starting local playback pauses
//! native Spotify (librespot releases the device when its sink stops); starting
//! Spotify tears the local session down (dropping it releases the device).
//!
//! ## Publish-once
//!
//! `local_playback` is set exactly once, in the success arm of [`start_local_queue`],
//! *after* the source is decoding. While it is `None` neither the playbar nor
//! the runtime tick touch local state, so the brief "opening" window is simply
//! invisible — there is no half-initialised state for a tick to misread.
