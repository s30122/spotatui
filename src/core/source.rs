//! Capability-based media-source traits — the seam for the multi-source refactor.
//!
//! A source is addressed by its URI **scheme** (`spotify:`, `file:`, `subsonic:`),
//! mirroring Mopidy's proven dispatch model. [`MediaSource`] is the required
//! minimum every source implements; the remaining traits are optional
//! capabilities discovered at runtime, so the UI can light up per source (e.g.
//! a source without [`LibraryProvider`] shows no "liked songs" tab).
//!
//! These are definitions only — implementations land in later slices
//! (`SpotifySource` over the existing `Network`, then `infra/local/` and
//! `infra/subsonic/`). All methods speak the domain types from
//! [`crate::core::plugin_api`]; rspotify types never appear here.
//!
//! **Dispatch.** These use native `async fn` in traits (matching the existing
//! `PlaybackNetwork` convention), which is *not* `dyn`-compatible. The planned
//! by-scheme routing therefore dispatches over a **closed enum** of concrete
//! sources (one variant per backend), matching on `scheme()` — not
//! `Box<dyn MediaSource>`. If open/plugin-provided sources are ever needed, add
//! the `async-trait` crate at that point rather than reaching for `dyn` here.

// No implementors in the binary yet; the multi-source slices wire these up.
