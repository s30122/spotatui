## Features

- **Multiple sources — Spotify optional.** Play from Spotify, [Local Files](#local-files), a [Subsonic/Navidrome](#subsonic--navidrome) server, [Internet Radio](#internet-radio), or [YouTube](#youtube). The free sources need no Spotify account; press `d` to switch between them at any time.
- **[Native streaming](#native-streaming).** Play Spotify audio directly, no official app or spotifyd required — spotatui appears as its own Spotify Connect device (Premium required).
- **Synced lyrics.** Line-by-line lyrics that follow playback.
- **Real-time audio visualizer.** A system-wide FFT visualizer (press `v`) that reacts to whatever is playing.
- **Cross-source play queue.** Press `z` on any track to queue it — the queue plays across every source before your current context resumes.
- **[Lua plugins](#plugins).** Extend spotatui with event hooks, commands, keybindings, popups, and theming.
- **Listening history & recap.** spotatui keeps a local play history and can generate a shareable HTML recap (`spotatui history recap`).
- **Full CLI.** Most of what the UI does is scriptable — playback, search, playlists, shell completions. Run `spotatui --help`.
- **Lightweight.** ~78 MB RAM while streaming, versus a full Electron client. See [Performance](#performance).

## Installation

> **Spotify is optional.** On first launch spotatui asks which source you want to use. YouTube, Subsonic/Navidrome, Internet Radio, and Local Files all work with no Spotify account. Spotify Premium is only needed for the Spotify source; you can add it anytime from the `d` menu.

```bash
# Homebrew (macOS only)
brew tap LargeModGames/spotatui
brew install spotatui

# Winget (Windows)
winget install spotatui

# Cargo
cargo install --locked spotatui

# Arch Linux (AUR) - pre-built binary (faster)
yay -S spotatui-bin

# Arch Linux (AUR) - build from source
yay -S spotatui

# Void Linux (Unofficial Repo)
echo repository=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Event-Horizon-VL/blackhole-vl/repository-x86_64 | sudo tee /etc/xbps.d/20-repository-extra.conf
sudo xbps-install -S spotatui
```
```nix
# NixOS (Flake)

# Add spotatui to your flake inputs:
inputs = {
  spotatui = {
    url = "github:LargeModGames/spotatui";
    inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };
}

# Add the spotatui package from your inputs to your config:
{ inputs, ...}:{
  # Your other configurations
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    inputs.spotatui.packages.${pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform.system}.default
  ];
}
```

Or download pre-built binaries from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/releases/latest).

See the [Installation Wiki](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/wiki/Installation) for platform-specific requirements and building from source.

## Quickstart

Run `spotatui`. On the first launch it asks which source to set up:

```
Welcome to spotatui! Choose your music source:

  1) Spotify        (needs login)
  2) YouTube        (free, needs the yt-dlp binary)
  3) Subsonic       (free, needs a Subsonic/Navidrome server)
  4) Internet Radio (free)
  5) Local Files    (free)
```

Pick a **free source** to skip Spotify entirely, or pick **Spotify** to run the auth wizard (you'll create a Spotify Developer app — see the [Installation Wiki](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/wiki/Installation#connecting-to-spotify)). Only sources compiled into your build are listed.

Once you're in:

- Press `?` for the in-app help menu of all key events.
- Press `d` to open the **Source & Device** picker and switch sources.
- Press `z` on a track to queue it; open the queue with `Shift+Q`.
- Run `spotatui --help` for the CLI. See the [Keybindings Wiki](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/wiki/Keybindings) for every shortcut.

A few CLI examples to get you started:

```bash
spotatui --completions zsh                       # Shell completions (bash, powershell, and more supported)
spotatui play --name "Your Playlist" --playlist --random  # Play a random song from a playlist
spotatui playback --toggle                       # Play/pause current playback
spotatui list --liked --limit 50                 # List your liked songs
spotatui history recap --period 30d --output ./recap.html  # Generate a shareable listening recap
```

### Adding Spotify later

Started with a free source and want Spotify too? Press `d`, select **Spotify**, and spotatui opens your browser to log in without restarting — enabling browsing, playlists, and controlling external devices right away. **Native (librespot) streaming still requires a restart**, since it initializes at startup.

## Music Sources

spotatui is a general music player, not just a Spotify client. Press `d` to open the **Source & Device** picker; the sidebar and search re-scope to the active source. Playback for these sources runs through spotatui's own audio engine, so volume control and the visualizer work exactly as they do for Spotify — and none of them need Spotify Premium.

| Source | What it does | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| **Local Files** | Browse and play a folder of audio files (FLAC, MP3, OGG, WAV, …) | Nothing; set `local_music_path` or use the OS music dir |
| **Subsonic** | Browse, search, and stream from any Subsonic-compatible server (Navidrome, Gonic, Airsonic, Funkwhale, …) | A server account |
| **Internet Radio** | Play icecast/shoutcast streams with live now-playing metadata; search the [radio-browser.info](https://www.radio-browser.info) directory (30k+ stations) | Nothing |
| **YouTube** | Search YouTube and play audio; build **local playlists** stored in a plain file | [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) on your `PATH` (ffmpeg recommended) |

**Resuming your last session:** quit while playing from a non-Spotify source and spotatui restores that track and its position on the next launch, following the `startup_behavior` setting (`continue`, `play`, or `pause`).

**Availability:** included in the Linux and Windows release binaries. Not yet on macOS (the shared audio output path is disabled there pending a fix; contributions welcome). When building from source, enable them with cargo features:

```bash
cargo install --locked spotatui --features local-files,subsonic,internet-radio,youtube
```

Each source has a few config keys; the essentials are below, and the full reference lives in the [Configuration Wiki](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/wiki/Configuration).

### Local Files

Set a folder (defaults to the OS music directory), then pick **Local Files** in the `d` picker:

```yaml
behavior:
  local_music_path: "/home/you/Music"
```

### Subsonic / Navidrome

```yaml
behavior:
  subsonic_url: "https://music.example.com"
  subsonic_username: "you"
```

Prefer setting the password via the `SPOTATUI_SUBSONIC_PASSWORD` environment variable so it never sits in the config file in plaintext.

### Internet Radio

Search the radio-browser.info directory in-app (Enter plays a station directly), and press the save key (`F` by default) to keep a station in your sidebar. Saved stations live under `behavior.radio_stations`; the playbar shows a `LIVE` badge with the stream's now-playing title.

### YouTube

Requires the [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) binary (`ffmpeg` recommended). No Google account, API key, or cookies — search and playback are anonymous. If playback breaks after a YouTube change, updating yt-dlp (`yt-dlp -U`) is the fix; no spotatui update needed.

**Local YouTube playlists** live in `~/.config/spotatui/youtube_playlists.yml`, a plain human-editable file you can back up or share. Create one from the sidebar, add tracks with `w`, and play a playlist as a queue with `Enter`.

## Native Streaming

spotatui can play Spotify audio directly, without spotifyd or the official app — just run it and it appears as a Spotify Connect device.

- Premium account required
- Works with media keys, MPRIS (Linux), and macOS Now Playing
- Runs on our maintained [librespot fork](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui-librespot), which backports upstream fixes for Spotify's evolving audio delivery (e.g. the HTTP 530 CDN issue that silenced native playback)

See the [Native Streaming Wiki](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/wiki/Native-Streaming) for setup details.

## Configuration

The config file is at `${HOME}/.config/spotatui/config.yml`. You can also configure spotatui in-app by pressing `Alt-,` to open Settings.

Nearly everything is customizable: keybindings, themes, icons, playbar button labels, status-line and window-title format templates, table columns (reorder/rename/resize), default sorting per screen, startup screen, and layout (sidebar/playbar position). Invalid values fall back to defaults with a logged warning — a config typo never blocks startup.

- Customization guide: [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md), with a commented [`examples/config.example.yml`](examples/config.example.yml)
- Full config reference: [Configuration Wiki](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/wiki/Configuration)
- Built-in themes (Spotify, Dracula, Nord, …): [Themes Wiki](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui/wiki/Themes)

spotatui also stores local listening history at `${HOME}/.config/spotatui/history/listens.jsonl`, which powers `spotatui history recap`. Short or skipped plays are stored but excluded from recap totals.

### Discord Rich Presence

Enabled by default using the built-in spotatui application ID, so no setup is required. Optional overrides:

```yaml
behavior:
  enable_discord_rpc: true
  discord_rpc_client_id: "your_client_id"
```

You can also override the app ID via `SPOTATUI_DISCORD_APP_ID`, or disable it in Settings or with `behavior.enable_discord_rpc: false`.

### Anonymous Song Counter

spotatui includes an opt-in global counter showing how many songs have been played by all users worldwide (the badge and chart at the top of this README). It is **completely anonymous** — no personal information, song names, artists, or listening history is collected; it only sends a simple increment when a new song starts. It is enabled by default and can be disabled with `enable_global_song_count: false` in `~/.config/spotatui/config.yml`. This is purely a fun community metric with zero tracking of individual users.

### GitHub Profile Widget

Show what you're listening to as a live card on your GitHub profile. Create an account at [spotatui.com](https://spotatui.com), paste your sync token into Settings → `sync_token`, then pick a public username and enable the widget on your dashboard. Add this to your profile README:

```markdown
[![Now playing on spotatui](https://spotatui.com/widget/your-username.svg)](https://spotatui.com)
```

The card shows cover art, title, artist, a progress bar, and an animated equalizer while playing; internet radio gets a LIVE badge. Append `?theme=light` for the light variant. Only your current track is public, and only after you opt in.

## Plugins

spotatui runs user-written Lua plugins. They react to playback events, add commands and key bindings, draw popups and playbar segments, restyle the theme, and make async HTTP requests. Install one published as a git repository (requires `git`):

```bash
spotatui plugin add owner/repo
spotatui plugin list
spotatui plugin update
spotatui plugin remove <name>
```

See [`PLUGINS.md`](PLUGINS.md) for the ecosystem overview, [`examples/plugins/`](examples/plugins) for runnable examples, and [`docs/scripting.md`](docs/scripting.md) for the full API reference.

## Performance

spotatui is extremely lightweight compared to the official Electron client.

| Mode                            | RAM Usage |
| :------------------------------ | :-------- |
| **Native Streaming (Base)**     | ~78 MB    |
| **With Synced Lyrics**          | ~78 MB    |
| **With System-Wide Visualizer** | ~80 MB    |

*Tested on Arch Linux (Hyprland).*

## Playback Requirements

The free sources (Local Files, Subsonic, Internet Radio, YouTube) play through spotatui's own audio engine and need no extra setup.

Spotify is different: it uses the [Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/), which doesn't stream audio itself. To play Spotify tracks you need **one** of:

1. **Native Streaming** — spotatui plays audio directly using its built-in streaming. See [Native Streaming](#native-streaming). *(Recommended.)*
2. **Official Spotify Client** — have the official app open on your computer.
3. **[spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd)** — a lightweight background alternative.

Playing Spotify tracks requires a **Premium** account. With a free Spotify account spotatui can authenticate and browse your library/search results, but playback actions (play/pause/seek/transfer) will not work in either native streaming or Web API playback control mode.

### Deprecated Spotify API Features

As of November 2024, Spotify removed access to certain API endpoints for new applications. The following features **only work if your Spotify Developer application was created before November 27, 2024**:

- **Related Artists** — the "Related Artists" section on an artist page.
- **Audio Analysis** — spotatui no longer depends on it. The **audio visualizer** (press `v`) now uses **local real-time FFT analysis** of your system audio, so it works regardless of your app's creation date:

  | Platform    | Status               | Notes                                    |
  | ----------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
  | **Windows** | Works out of the box | Uses WASAPI loopback                     |
  | **Linux**   | Works out of the box | Uses PipeWire/PulseAudio monitor devices |
  | **macOS**   | Requires setup       | Needs a virtual audio device (see below) |

  > **macOS:** macOS doesn't natively expose system audio loopback. Install a virtual audio device like [BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole) (free) or [Loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/) (paid), route system audio through it, and set it as your default input device.
  >
  > **Note:** The visualizer is **system-wide** — it captures all audio on your system, so it also reacts to YouTube videos, games, and any other source.

For more information, see [Spotify's announcement about API changes](https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2024-11-27-changes-to-the-web-api).

## Using with [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd)

> **Note:** If you're using native streaming, you don't need spotifyd!

Follow the spotifyd documentation to get set up. After that:

1. Start the spotifyd daemon.
1. Start `spotatui`.
1. Press `d` to open the device selection menu — the spotifyd "device" should appear (if not, check [these docs](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd#logging)).

## Migrating from spotify-tui

If you used the original `spotify-tui` before:

- The binary name changed from `spt` to `spotatui`.
- Config paths changed: `~/.config/spotify-tui/` → `~/.config/spotatui/`.

You can copy your existing config:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/spotatui
cp -r ~/.config/spotify-tui/* ~/.config/spotatui/
```

You may be asked to re-authenticate with Spotify the first time.

## Libraries used

- [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) - Terminal UI framework
- [rspotify](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify) - Spotify Web API client
- [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) - Spotify Connect streaming (via our maintained fork [spotatui-librespot](https://github.com/LargeModGames/spotatui-librespot), which backports fixes for Spotify's CDN changes)
- [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) - Async runtime
- [crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm) - Terminal manipulation

## Development

1. [Install OpenSSL](https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.25/openssl/#automatic)
1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
1. [Install `xorg-dev`](https://github.com/aweinstock314/rust-clipboard#prerequisites) (required for clipboard support)
1. **Linux only:** Install PipeWire development libraries (required for audio visualization)
   ```bash
   # Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install libpipewire-0.3-dev libspa-0.2-dev

   # Arch Linux
   sudo pacman -S pipewire

   # Fedora
   sudo dnf install pipewire-devel
